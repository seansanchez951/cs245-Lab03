1. Runtime Analysis

The time complexity for the wiggleSort function is O(N)
There is space allocated for the integer array "nums"
Considering the if statements, as well as the swap function, these are constants.
The swap function is just three consecutive declarations. So swap function is constant O(N)
The if statements run based on size of array. So it is O(n)
There is only one for loop that runs proportional to the size of n.
All together the total running time is O(N)
